### DESCRIPTION

**Website**: URL

#### Depends on few packages and scripts installed on first run if not already present.

Install with:

    * kcp -i PKGNAME

#### From developer(s):

##### Target

If you like/need to often install new systems (while simply reinstalling your favorite non-rolling linux distribution, or when testing new isos...), or are looking for a complete and wizard driven restoring system. Give it a try...

##### Features

_**WARNING: I'm no developer, I'm just a linux daily user and want/need to learn, I always had difficulties to studdy so I try writing while reading, even if most commits will only "fix stuffs"...**_

Basically it should soon:

```
      * Restore user selection of packages to install back all user prefered applications, restore user saved config files & folders(.config folder and so...).
      * By restoring user environment it will ask for what prompt you want to use, which librairies you want installed... 
      * It use all available know application to dialog via X (yad, zenity, kdialog...)

    Moreover futur developments should add multi-desktops support aswell as multi-distributions support.
    
    **ONCE FOR ALL:** It's in early development stage and is actually not usable as it is...
```
